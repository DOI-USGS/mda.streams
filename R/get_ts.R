#' Bring one or more timeseries into R and merge them
#' 
#' The timeseries are iteratively joined, starting by joining the second element
#' of \code{var_src} to the first, then adding in the third, etc. This method 
#' means you have control, not just through the \code{method} and
#' \code{approx_tol} arguments but also through how you order the elements of
#' \code{var_src}, with consequences for the size and contents of the resulting
#' data.frame.
#' 
#' Downloads each file from SB if either (1) the file has not yet been downloaded
#' to the code{tempdir()} during this R session, or (2) 
#' \code{on_local_exists='replace'}. There's a small risk that the resulting ts 
#' will be out of date relative to ScienceBase, but the benefit is faster 
#' ts-getting.
