## Package Support

`mda.streams` was developed 2015-2017 with support from the USGS Powell Center (through a working group on Continental Patterns of Stream Metabolism), the USGS NAWQA program, and the USGS Office of Water Information. Ongoing package maintenance is unsupported and therefore minimal.
